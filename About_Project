Credit Risk Prediction Application
Overview
This application is a machine learning-powered tool designed to predict credit risk for loan applicants. Using advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques, the system evaluates various applicant attributes to determine whether they represent a good or bad credit risk. The application features an intuitive user interface built with Streamlit that allows for both model exploration and real-time predictions.
Technical Implementation
Core Technology Stack

Python: Core programming language
Streamlit: Web application framework
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model development
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computing
Matplotlib: Data visualization

Machine Learning Pipeline
The application implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling of missing values through median imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features
One-hot encoding of categorical variables to transform them into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms
Feature standardization using StandardScaler to normalize the scale of input variables


Model Development:

Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators, leveraging ensemble learning principles
Stratified train-test split (80/20) to ensure balanced class representation in both training and testing sets
Hyperparameter configuration optimized for credit risk assessment


Model Evaluation:

ROC-AUC scoring to assess discriminative power (ability to distinguish between good and bad credit risks)
Comprehensive classification report including precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics
Visual ROC curve representation to illustrate the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity


Feature Importance Analysis:

Random Forest built-in feature importance calculation to identify the most predictive variables
Visual representation of top features influencing credit risk decisions
